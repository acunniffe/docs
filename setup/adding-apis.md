# Adding APIs
To begin using Optic with one of your repositories you have to create a new API project on Optic's webapp. 

1. First navigate to **Projects**
2. Click **+ Add API** and name your project
4. Press **Finish**

The project will be created and Optic will redirect you to the new API. Once you're on this page, a guided setup wizard will help you get your repository connected to Optic.
